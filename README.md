# Drum Machine

This app gives you a small drum kit with 9 pads. They can be activated by clicking or pressing the corresponding keyboard key. The sound will play and in the display, it shows you the name of the sound/instrument. The keys invert their color when clicked/pressed to indicate the sound being played. Pressing a pad rapidly will keep restarting the sound and won't let the sound keep playing and overlapping itself.
